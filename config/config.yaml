# ChronoCore Engine Config

# This file controls how the RaceEngine behaves during live timing.
# Every section has safe defaults for club-level racing (10–60 karts).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Timing rules
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
timing:
  # Minimum valid lap time in seconds.
  # Any lap shorter than this is ignored (likely a double-hit or glitch).
  min_lap_s: 1.0

  # Minimum separation in seconds for duplicate tag hits.
  # If a transponder triggers multiple times at the line within this window,
  # only the first is counted; others are ignored.
  min_lap_s_dup: 1.0

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature toggles
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
features:
  # Pit lane timing system.
  # When true, passes can be marked as "pit_in" and "pit_out" to measure pit stops.
  # If false, all passes are treated as track crossings.
  pit_timing: true

  # Auto-provisional entrants.
  # When true, unknown tags create a new entrant named "Unknown ####"
  # (#### = last 4 digits of tag UID) and their laps are recorded.
  # When false, unknown tags are simply ignored.
  auto_provisional: true

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Persistence / durability
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
persistence:
  # Enable event journaling and checkpointing to SQLite.
  # Strongly recommended for real races — lets you recover after a crash.
  enabled: true

  # Max time to buffer events before flushing to disk (ms).
  # Larger values = fewer writes, less disk I/O, but slightly more risk
  # (you could lose up to batch_ms worth of events if the PC dies).
  batch_ms: 500

  # Max number of events to buffer before forcing a flush.
  # Larger = fewer writes, smaller = lower latency.
  batch_max: 200

  # Write a full engine snapshot every N seconds.
  # Used for crash recovery (engine can replay from last checkpoint).
  checkpoint_s: 15

  # Force the OS to flush writes all the way to disk on every commit.
  # True = maximum durability, slower.
  # False = faster, but a power loss could drop the last few seconds.
  fsync: true

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pit receiver mapping (optional)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pits:
  receivers:
    # Lists of device_id values that should be auto-classified as pit_in/out
    # if they show up on /engine/pass.
    # If empty, you must send "source":"pit_in" or "source":"pit_out" manually.
    pit_in:  []
    pit_out: []
