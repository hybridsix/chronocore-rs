# ChronoCore Technical Reference Guide

This document provides a comprehensive reference to the design, architecture, and operation of the ChronoCore Race Software.  
It is intended for engineers, contributors, and technically curious operators who want to understand the internals of the system.  
Lightweight summaries are included for quick readers, while detailed flows and appendices support deeper study.

## 1. System Overview
High-level description of what the software does, major components, and intended use cases.  
**TBD**

---

## 2. Architecture
Overview of the backend engine, persistence layer, frontend clients, and interfaces to timing hardware.  
**TBD**

---

## 3. Decoder Subsystems

All hardware decoders present timing passes into the engine via a uniform interface:

```python
ENGINE.ingest_pass(tag=<str>, device_id=<optional str>, source="track")
```

The backend implements several decoder classes in `backend/decoder.py`. Each runs in its own thread, parses hardware output, and emits standardized passes.

### 3.1 Supported Decoder Types (2025)

| Mode              | Class                   | Transport  | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|-------|
| `ilap_serial`     | `ILapSerialDecoder`     | USB/serial | Default PRS decoder. SOH-framed lines beginning with `@`. Optional `init_7digit` command resets decoder clock. |
| `ambrc_serial`    | `AMBRcSerialDecoder`    | USB/serial | AMB/MyLaps legacy protocol. Accepts CSV, key=val, or regex-defined formats. |
| `trackmate_serial`| `TrackmateSerialDecoder`| USB/serial | Trackmate IR system. Typically `<tag>` or `<decoder>,<tag>`. |
| `cano_tcp`        | `CANOTcpDecoder`        | TCP line   | Covers CANO protocol (used by some DIY and Impinj Speedway bridges). One line per pass. |
| `tcp_line`        | `TCPLineDecoder`        | TCP line   | Alias for CANO TCP, kept for backward compatibility. |
| `mock`            | `MockDecoder`           | internal   | Emits a fake tag on a timer; useful for testing without hardware. |

### 3.2 Configuration (`config/config.yaml`)

Example:

```yaml
app:
  decoder:
    enabled: true
    mode: ilap_serial

    serial:
      port: "COM3"
      baud: 9600
      timeout_s: 0.25

    tcp:
      host: "127.0.0.1"
      port: 3000

    ilap:
      init_7digit: true

    # Regex override (AMBrc, advanced)
    # line_regex: "(?i)decoder=(?P<decoder>\\w+).*?tag=(?P<tag>\\w+)"

    reconnect_delay_s: 2.0
    mock_tag: "3000999"
    mock_period_s: 6.0
```

- **Switching decoders**: Change `mode:` to the desired type.  
- **Serial devices**: Confirm `port` is correct for the host system.  
- **TCP devices**: Configure `host` and `port`.  
- **Regex hook**: Provides flexibility for vendor-specific AMBrc variants.  
- **Pit routing**: `routing.pit_in_receivers` and `routing.pit_out_receivers` can auto-classify passes from specific device IDs.

## 4. Race Engine

### 4.1 Logical Flow
The following describes the authoritative race loop and how it processes events in real time.

**ChronoCore Race Engine — Logical Flow**

1. **Initialization (`engine.load`)**  
   The operator creates a new race with a unique `race_id` and roster of entrants.  
   Each entrant has: `entrant_id`, enabled/disabled flag, status (`ACTIVE`, `DISABLED`, `DNF`, `DQ`),  
   a car number, a name, and optionally a tag UID.  
   Only enabled entrants are eligible to score laps. The engine builds a race-local tag → entrant map.

2. **Flags and Clock (`engine.set_flag`)**  
   Race control sets flags (pre, green, yellow, red, white, checkered).  
   - First transition to green starts the race clock (monotonic timer).  
   - Red flag: laps still count, but marshals manage discipline.  
   - Yellow flag: no special logic; cars may pass if needed.  
   - Checkered: when the leader next crosses, the race clock and standings freeze.

3. **Pass Ingestion (`engine.ingest_pass`)**  
   A pass arrives with `{ tag, ts_ns?, source, device_id? }`.  
   - If the tag belongs to an enabled entrant, it is processed.  
   - If unknown and `auto_provisional = true`, a new provisional entrant is created as `"Unknown ####"`.  
   - If the entrant is disabled, the pass is ignored.  
   - **Track passes**: compute lap time, apply filters (`min_lap_s`, `min_lap_s_dup`), update `laps/last/best/pace_5`.  
   - **Pit passes** (if pit_timing enabled): `pit_in` starts a pit window; `pit_out` closes the window, computes pit time, increments `pit_count`.

4. **Standings Calculation (`engine.snapshot`)**  
   Called for `/race/state` endpoint.  
   - Updates clock (unless frozen).  
   - Entrants are ordered: `laps desc → best asc → last asc → entrant_id asc`.  
   - Each entrant snapshot includes: `laps`, `last`, `best`, `pace_5`, `gap_s`, `lap_deficit`, `pit_count`, `last_pit_s`.  
   - Snapshot also reports global state (`flag`, `race_id`, `clock`, `running`, `last_update_utc`).

5. **Event Logging (Journal)**  
   If persistence is enabled, every pass, flag change, and roster change is appended to SQLite as an event row.  
   - Every *N* seconds (`checkpoint_s`), a full snapshot is written as a checkpoint.  
   - On crash recovery: load last checkpoint, replay events to rebuild state.

6. **Roster Management**  
   Entrants can be enabled/disabled mid-race (`enabled = false` → passes ignored).  
   - Status (`ACTIVE`, `DISABLED`, `DNF`, `DQ`) can be updated mid-race for classification.  
   - Tags can be reassigned mid-race (useful for swapping transponders).

7. **Post-Race Analysis**  
   `/race/state` gives the live, authoritative view.  
   The SQLite journal provides historical detail for exports, replay, and audits.  
   Operator can merge or reassign provisionals to real entrants without losing data.

**Summary**  
The RaceEngine keeps live scoring fast and authoritative in RAM, while optional persistence ensures data durability.  
Standings are always consistent, flag changes are logged, and provisional entrants capture surprises.  
This design balances speed, safety, and flexibility for real-world race control.

---

## 5. Persistence and Recovery

ChronoCore uses an SQLite event journal to ensure data durability and enable crash recovery. Every significant event (like a pass, flag change, or roster modification) is logged as an event row.

- **Checkpoints**: Every N seconds (`checkpoint_s`), the engine writes a full snapshot of the race state to the database. This ensures that in the event of a crash, we can reload the last checkpoint and replay subsequent events to reconstruct the race.

- **Recovery**: On restart, the engine loads the last checkpoint and replays all events from that point forward, ensuring no data loss and consistent standings.

This persistence layer balances speed and reliability, providing a durable record for audits and post-race analysis.

---

## 6. Database Schema

The core race data is stored in an SQLite database. Key tables include:

- **`passes`**: Stores each timing pass event with fields like `tag`, `timestamp`, `entrant_id`, and `lap_number`.

- **`transponders`**: Maps physical transponder tags to entrants and their car numbers.

- **`events`**: Logs all flag changes, roster updates, and other significant race events for auditing and replay.

Future sections can include example queries, migration scripts, and how to extend the schema.

## 7. API Endpoints

ChronoCore exposes a set of REST endpoints via FastAPI. Below is a detailed reference of each endpoint, including methods, parameters, responses, and key notes.

### 7.1 API Reference Table

| Endpoint          | Method | Params / Body                                  | Response                                            | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/race/state`     | GET    | None                                           | `{ race_id, race_type, flag, running, clock_ms, ... }` | Returns the authoritative snapshot of current race state.            |
|                   |        |                                                | `standings: [ { entrant_id, tag, number, ... } ]`| UIs poll this at ~3 Hz for live updates.                              |
|                   |        |                                                | `last_update_utc, features`                         |                                                                       |
| `/engine/flag`    | POST   | `{ "flag": "pre" | "green" | "yellow" ... }` | `{ "ok": true }`                                     | Sets the current race flag. `green` starts the clock; `checkered` freezes it. `blue` is informational only. |
| `/engine/pass`    | POST   | `{ tag, ts_ns?, source, device_id? }`          | `{ ok, entrant_id, lap_added, lap_time_s, reason }` | Ingests a timing pass. Adds a lap if Δt ≥ min_lap_s (default ~5.0s).  |
| `/engine/load`    | POST   | `{ race_id, entrants: [ ... ] }`               | `{ "ok": true }`                                     | Initializes a new race session with a given roster.                   |
| `/engine/snapshot`| GET    | None                                           | Same as `/race/state` response                      | Alias for `/race/state`.                                              |

### 7.2 Spectator UI Contract
- **Single source of truth:** `/race/state` only.
- **Flag classes:** `.flag.flag--{lowercase_color}` plus modifiers:
  - `.flag.is-pulsing` for attention states (yellow, red, blue, checkered).
  - `.flag.flag--green.flash` one-shot on entering green.
- **Accessibility:** Banner label shows `"Color - Meaning"` (e.g., *“White - Final Lap”*, *“Blue - Driver Swap”*).

### 7.3 Static Pathing
- FastAPI mounts UI at `/ui`.
- Expected structure: **TBD**

## 11. Engine Host Discovery

## Background

Older builds assumed the Operator UI always talked to `localhost:8000`. This created confusion when running the UI remotely or in the field.

The system now defines **engine host resolution policy** in `app.yaml` as the single source of truth. UIs follow the same precedence rules everywhere.

## Location

Defaults live in:

- `config/app.yaml` → `app.client.engine`
- `config/config.yaml` → (deprecated; may mirror for legacy tools)

## Precedence Order

1. **Same-origin** (if `prefer_same_origin: true` and UI is served by the engine)  
2. **Device override** (if `allow_client_override: true` and set in localStorage `cc.engine_host`)  
3. **Policy fallback** (from YAML):  
   - `mode: fixed` → `fixed_host`  
   - `mode: localhost` → `127.0.0.1:8000`  
   - `mode: auto` → try same-origin, then fixed_host, then localhost  
4. **Last resort**: same-origin again if available.

## Example Configurations

### Development laptop

```yaml
app:
  client:
    engine:
      mode: localhost
      allow_client_override: true
```

### Field deployment (fixed IP)

```yaml
app:
  client:
    engine:
      mode: fixed
      fixed_host: "10.77.0.10:8000"
      allow_client_override: false
```

### Mixed environment

```yaml
app:
  client:
    engine:
      mode: auto
      fixed_host: "10.77.0.10:8000"
      prefer_same_origin: true
      allow_client_override: true
```

## Operator UI Behavior

- **Settings page** shows the configured host and whether overrides are allowed.  
- **Footer status pill** always displays the *effective engine host* and connection status.  
- **Race Control and Setup** pages always use the resolved host; they do not hardcode `localhost`.

## Notes for Developers

- The launcher (desktop, `file://`) must bootstrap the YAML defaults, since same-origin is not possible there.  
- Browser-served UIs can skip host strings entirely when `prefer_same_origin` is true.
